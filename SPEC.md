# Pack2Go - Project Specification

## Overview

Pack2Go is a smart travel guide web application (MERN stack) that helps users plan, organize, and share trips. It focuses on personalized itineraries, contextual packing checklists, cost estimation, destination discovery, and offline-friendly access to trip details. The platform also supports specialized trip types (holidays, business trips, events), local recommendations (restaurants, hotels, attractions), and premium features like AI-generated itineraries for destinations.

---

## Vision

Enable travellers to go from idea to ready-to-pack in minutes. Pack2Go should make trip planning faster, safer, and more personalized by combining maps, weather-aware packing advice, budget planning, curated recommendations, and smart premium itinerary generation.

---

## Audience

* Students and solo travellers building short trips
* Families and groups planning multi-day itineraries
* Professionals traveling for business
* Event-goers who need a structured travel plan

---

## Must-have Features (MVP)

1. Authentication (email/password, JWT) and user profile (preferences: budget range, travel style, food restrictions)
2. Trip categories: Holidays, Business Trips, Events
3. Itinerary builder (create/edit/delete trips with day-by-day activities)
4. Destination search using Google Maps / Places API (autocomplete + lat/lng)
5. Weather integration (OpenWeatherMap or similar) for trip dates and location
6. Packing checklist generator that adapts to weather, duration, and trip type
7. Budget calculator (transport, accommodation, food, activities, total) and per-day estimate
8. Places to visit, restaurants nearby, hotels to stay (using Places API)
9. Save and load itineraries from MongoDB (per user)
10. Responsive UI (desktop + mobile)
11. Notifications/reminders for upcoming trips or activities
12. Deployable frontend and backend with environment config

2. Advanced destination suggestions based on preferences and budget
3. Currency converter and local cost suggestions (via Exchange Rate API)
4. Public events integration (local events API)
5. Push notifications / email reminders for trip milestones
